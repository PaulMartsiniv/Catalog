1) find duplicates in the array (most efficient way)

for example, if the array has the following elements
1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 7, 6, 6, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7

we need to find a count for each duplication

for example
here we have 2 - 2
6 - 2
7 - 3


2) CRUD operations (5days)

   we need to implement a simple product catalog

+ the catalog should have product categories
+ we need the ability to move products from one category to other
+ product category should have at least 1 nested level of subcategories
+ we need to provide the total sum for all products in the category
+ we need the ability to sort, paginate products inside the category
+ implement search products in category and subcategories by using different characteristics
+ there should be at least 5 product characteristics and 2 subcategories
- unit tests for most important functionality mandatory
